abstract: This paper studies the role of short-time work arrangements (ERTEs) when aggregate risk has a sector-specific component. That has been the case of Spain, where both the Great Recession and the pandemic crisis (aka the Great Contagion) can be interpreted as being largely driven by large sector-specific shocks. However, the latter episode shows much less labor reallocation than the former because ERTEs were used extensively by  firms. We show that these furlough schemes stabilize unemployment rates by allowing workers to remain matched with their employers in highly affected sectors. However, under their current design, ERTEs crowd out labor hoarding exerted by employers when these schemes are not available, as well as they increase the volatility of employment rates and output. Interestingly, we show both theoretically and empirically that they slow down worker reallocation away from the sectors worse hit by the negative shocks to other sectors which are less affected or even favoured.
