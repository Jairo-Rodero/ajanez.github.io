abstract: We develop a general equilibrium model where wage dispersion between managers and production workers stems from heterogeneous wage markdowns and firm organizational decisions. Quantifying the model to administrative data covering the universe of private firms in Portugal, we show that monopsony power reduces wage dispersion between occupations by 12 percent and generates welfare losses through distorting firms' managerial delegation decisions. The recent rise in the Portuguese minimum wage only mitigates the welfare loss from monopsony for managers. This policy increases wages for both occupations but only rises employment for managers, who benefit from the induced labor relocation of a portion of production workers toward large firms.
